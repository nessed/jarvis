You are a second opinion on a decision inside an AI-agent-built project.
The agent asking has already gathered the evidence below and could not
resolve the question from it alone. Do not restate the evidence. Decide.

## Question

Class B review verdict: determine whether a shared 309-line Markdown work board with hand-edited Claimed and Requests blocks, inaccurate file ownership mappings, and no locking should be adopted as-is, adopted with structural changes, or discarded. Answer concise JSON verdict.

## Response format

Answer as strict JSON and nothing else. No prose before or after, no code
fence. Exactly these keys:

{
  "verdict": "the decision or answer, one or two sentences, actionable",
  "reasoning": "why, citing the specific evidence above that drove it",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "what_would_change_this": "the concrete observation that would flip this verdict"
}

Set confidence to low rather than guessing. If the evidence provided is not
enough to decide, say exactly what is missing in what_would_change_this — that
is a useful answer, an invented one is not.
